## Task 1
Firstly, I scale a sphere to the estimated scale of oranges in real life (8cm). After that build assets in the scale compared to the oranges, such as the crate should be able to carry four oranges on the long side, two on the short side, and around 1.5 oranges tall.

Most of the stuff are mono-color so I just merge all points into a single point and pick a colors. There are some assets that are multi-color such as the jar, which I mark the seam where the color are different and put the UV into the right colors respectively.
