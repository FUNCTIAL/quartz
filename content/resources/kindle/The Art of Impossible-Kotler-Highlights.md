They lie beyond our wildest dreams in the most literal sense. Paradigm-shifting breakthroughs. Four-minute miles. Moonshots. Call this category capital I Impossible. ^ref-5858

lowercase i impossible. The same rules apply, as this is still the stuff beyond our capabilities and our imagination, just on a different scale. Lowercase i impossibles are those things that we believe are impossible for us. They’re the feats that no one, including ourselves, at least for a while, ever imagined we’d be capable of accomplishing. ^ref-59396

---

if you devote your life to accomplishing lowercase i impossibles, you can sometimes end up accomplishing a capital I impossible along the way. ^ref-30704

Whenever the impossible becomes possible, there’s always a formula. ^ref-509

Personality doesn’t scale. Biology scales.” ^ref-50600

Flow is defined as “an optimal state of consciousness where we feel our best and perform our best.” ^ref-8380

---

those moments of rapt attention and total absorption when you get so focused on the task at hand that everything else disappears. Action and awareness merge. Your sense of self vanishes. Time passes strangely. And performance—performance just soars. ^ref-59091

The philosopher James Carse uses the terms “finite games” and “infinite games” to describe the main ways we live and play here on Earth. ^ref-56178

---
— location: [213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=213)
finite game is just that—finite. It has a finite number of options and players, clearly defined winners and losers, and an established set of rules. ^ref-64452

---
— location: [215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=215)
Infinite games are the opposite. They have no clear winners or losers, no established time frame for play, and no fixed rules. In infinite games, the field of play is mutable, the number of participants keeps changing, and the only goal is to keep on playing. Art, science, and love are infinite games. Most important: so is peak performance. ^ref-419

the reason we’re not living up to our potential is that we’re not in the habit of living up to our potential. We’ve automatized the wrong processes. We’re playing the wrong game. ^ref-10033

What do we know for sure? You get one shot at this life, and you’re going to spend one-third of it asleep. So what do you choose to do with the remaining two-thirds? That is the only question that matters. ^ref-8654

Motivation is what gets you into this game; learning is what helps you continue to play; creativity is how you steer; and flow is how you turbo-boost the results beyond all rational standards and reasonable expectations. ^ref-54607

four main sections, exploring motivation, learning, creativity, and flow ^ref-14133

motivation, as psychologists use the term, is actually a catch-all for three subsets of skills: drive, grit, and goals. ^ref-57455

---
— location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=261)
Drive, the subject of the next two chapters, refers to powerful emotional motivators such as curiosity, passion, and purpose. ^ref-32718

---
— location: [266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=266)
Goals, the topic of chapter 4, are about figuring out exactly where we’re actually trying to go. ^ref-47246

---
— location: [269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=269)
Grit, the subject of chapter 5, is what most people think of when they think of motivation. It’s persistence, determination, and fortitude—the ability to continue with the journey no matter the difficulty involved. ^ref-29393

psychological drivers into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic. ^ref-33770

---
— location: [296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=296)
Extrinsic drivers are rewards that are external to ourselves. ^ref-31844

---
— location: [300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=300)
Intrinsic drivers are the opposite. These are psychological and emotional forces such as curiosity, passion, meaning, and purpose. The pleasure of mastery, which we feel as the sensation of a job well done, is another potent example. Autonomy, the desire to be in charge of one’s own life, is yet another. ^ref-37874

Once people feel fairly compensated for their time—meaning once that number starts to creep over $75,000 a year—big raises and annual bonuses won’t actually improve their productivity or performance. ^ref-37528

four basic components: neurochemistry and neuroelectricity, which are the messages themselves, and neuroanatomy and networks, which are the places those messages are sent from and received. ^ref-51997

---
— location: [325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=325)
electrical signals have only one meaning: do more of what you’re doing. ^ref-27586

---
— location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=328)
Chemical signals are similarly simple, though they can have one of two meanings: do more of what you’re doing, or do less of what you’re been doing. ^ref-51446

---
— location: [336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=336)
Neuroanatomy describes specific brain structures: the insula or the medial prefrontal cortex. ^ref-28068

---
— location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=340)
Networks, meanwhile, refer to brain structures that are hardwired together by direct connections or structures that tend to activate at the same time. ^ref-19802

Dopamine specializes in driving all the various manifestations of desire, ^ref-50387

Norepinephrine is similar but different. It’s the brain’s version of adrenaline, sometimes called noradrenaline. This neurochemical produces a huge increase in energy and alertness, stimulating both hyperactivity and hypervigilance. ^ref-20792

Oxytocin produces trust, love, and friendship.12 It’s the “pro-social” ^ref-56258

Serotonin is a calming, peaceful chemical ^ref-15951

Endorphins and anandamide, our final two pleasure chemicals, are pain-killing bliss producers. They’re both heavy-duty stress relievers, replacing the weight of the everyday with a euphoric sense of relaxed happiness. ^ref-56778

---
— location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B087CL5574&location=376)
Flow may be the biggest neurochemical cocktail of all. ^ref-13284

cultivate, align, amplify, and deploy—our five most potent intrinsic drivers: curiosity, passion, purpose (chapter 2), autonomy, and mastery (chapter 3). ^ref-20839

Start by writing down twenty-five things you’re curious about. And by curious, all I mean is that if you had a spare weekend, you’d be interested in reading a couple of books on the topic, attending a few lectures, and maybe having a conversation or two with an expert. ^ref-35869
