We know how this ends. You’re going to die and so will everyone you love. And then there will be heat death. ^ref-33123

Human life, in all its noise and hubris, will be rendered meaningless for eternity. ^ref-60756

Humans might be in unique possession of the knowledge that our existence is essentially meaningless, but we carry on as if in ignorance of it. We beetle away happily, into our minutes, hours and days, with the fact of the void hovering over us. To look directly into it, and respond with an entirely rational descent into despair, is to be diagnosed with a mental-health condition, categorised as somehow faulty. ^ref-25920

The cure for the horror is story. Our brains distract us from this terrible truth by filling our lives with hopeful goals and encouraging us to strive for them. ^ref-24959

Stories are everywhere. Stories are us. ^ref-50618

experience our day-to-day lives in story mode. The brain creates a world for us to live in and populates it with allies and villains. It turns the chaos and bleakness of reality into a simple, hopeful tale, and at the centre it places its star – wonderful, precious me ^ref-33527

Story is what brain does. It is a ‘story processor’, writes the psychologist Professor Jonathan Haidt, ‘not a logic processor’. Story emerges from human minds as naturally as breath emerges from between human lips. ^ref-62542

things the story theorists were saying about narrative were strikingly similar to what the psychologists and neuroscientists I’d been interviewing had been telling me about brain and mind. The storytellers and the scientists had started off in completely different places and had ended up discovering the same things. ^ref-15380

what follows will be of interest to anyone curious about the science of the human condition, even if they have little practical interest in storytelling. But it’s also for the storytellers. The challenge any of us faces is that of grabbing and keeping the attention of other people’s brains. I’m convinced we can all become better at what we do by finding out a bit about how they work. ^ref-19296

traditional attempts at decoding story. These typically involve scholars comparing successful stories or traditional myths from around the world and working out what they have in common. ^ref-52982

The most influential of these is undoubtedly Joseph Campbell’s ‘Monomyth’, which, in its full form, has seventeen parts that track the phases of a hero’s journey from their initial ‘call to adventure’ onwards. ^ref-55679

the problem with the traditional approach is that it’s led to a preoccupation with these structural recipes. It’s easy to see why this has happened. Often the search has been for the One True Story – the ultimate, perfect plot structure by which every tale can be judged. And how are you going to describe that if not by dissecting it into its various movements? ^ref-37106

It’s people, not events, that we’re naturally interested in. It’s the plight of specific, flawed and fascinating individuals that makes us cheer, weep and ram our heads into the sofa cushion. ^ref-13018

moral outrage, unexpected change, status play, specificity, curiosity, and so on. By understanding them, we can more easily create stories that are gripping, profound, emotional and original. ^ref-31116

One benefit of understanding the science of storytelling is that it illuminates the ‘whys’ behind the ‘rules’ we’re commonly given. Such knowledge should be empowering. Knowing why the rules are the rules means we know how to break them intelligently and successfully. ^ref-62092

compelling, profound and original plots are more likely to emerge from character than from a bullet-pointed list. ^ref-8231

Many stories begin with a moment of unexpected change. And that’s how they continue too. ^ref-8495

‘Almost all perception is based on the detection of change’ says the neuroscientist Professor Sophie Scott. ‘Our perceptual systems basically don’t work unless there are changes to detect.’ In a stable environment, the brain is relatively calm. But when it detects change, that event is immediately registered as a surge of neural activity. ^ref-55462

Control is why brains are on constant alert for the unexpected. Unexpected change is a portal through which danger arrives ^ref-13486

Paradoxically, however, change is also an opportunity. It’s the crack in the universe through which the future arrives. Change is hope. Change is promise. It’s our winding path to a more successful tomorrow. ^ref-49097

Unexpected change makes us curious, and curious is how we should feel in the opening movements of an effective story. ^ref-4973

---
— location: [195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07WXJTR9Q&location=195)
This is what storytellers do. They create moments of unexpected change that seize the attention of their protagonists and, by extension, their readers and viewers. ^ref-6676

John Yorke has written that ‘the image every TV director in fact or fiction always looks for is the close-up of the human face as it registers change.’ ^ref-18297

---
— location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07WXJTR9Q&location=200)
These changeful moments are so important, they’re often packed into a story’s first sentences: ^ref-39095

---

Humans have an extraordinary thirst for knowledge. Storytellers excite these instincts by creating worlds but stopping short of telling readers everything about them. ^ref-4267

Brains, concluded the researchers, seem to become spontaneously curious when presented with an ‘information set’ they realise is incomplete. ‘There is a natural inclination to resolve information gaps,’ wrote Loewenstein, ‘even for questions of no importance.’ ^ref-34498

---
— location: [258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07WXJTR9Q&location=258)
concluded Loewenstein, a ‘positive relationship between curiosity and knowledge’. The more context we learn about a mystery, the more anxious we become to solve it. As the stories reveal more of themselves, we increasingly want to know, Where is Spot? Who is ‘Bunny’ and how did he die and how is the narrator implicated in his death? ^ref-12889
