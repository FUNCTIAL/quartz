Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable. ^ref-50579

The design of the door should indicate how to work it without any need for signs, certainly without any need for trial and error. ^ref-54389

Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean? ^ref-42992

industrial designers emphasizing form and material, interactive designers emphasizing understandability and usability, and experience designers emphasizing the emotional impact. ^ref-31831

Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer ^ref-33257

Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience. ^ref-13668

---
— location: [299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=299)
Experience design: The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience. ^ref-17133

It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines. ^ref-42912

much of the design is done by engineers who are experts in technology but limited in their understanding of people. ^ref-40620

The problem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be. ^ref-65428

---
— location: [334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=334)
we were designing things for people, so we needed to understand both technology and people. ^ref-62906

human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. ^ref-45150

---

Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible, what is happening, and what is about to happen. ^ref-35483

Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned. ^ref-52445

---

HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. ^ref-5004

---
— location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=381)
Doing HCD within the rigid time, budget, and other constraints of industry can be a challenge: ^ref-12098

When we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to work it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible: discoverability. ^ref-55324

---
— location: [396](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=396)
Discoverability results from appropriate application of five fundamental psychological concepts covered in the next few chapters: affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, and feedback. ^ref-50085

there is a sixth principle, perhaps most important of all: the conceptual model of the system. ^ref-37310

An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. ^ref-20004

---
— location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=412)
affordance is not a property. An affordance is a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the properties of both the object and the agent. ^ref-45924

---
— location: [416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=416)
anti-affordance—the prevention of interaction. ^ref-64633

---
— location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=419)
If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: ^ref-7955

---
— location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=438)
Perceived affordances help people figure out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions. ^ref-19347

---
— location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=456)
Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both. ^ref-55598

---
— location: [465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=465)
Signifiers can be deliberate and intentional, such as the sign PUSH on a door, but they may also be accidental and unintentional, such as our use of the visible trail made by previous people walking through a field or over a snow-covered terrain to determine the best path. Or how we might use the presence or absence of people waiting at a train station to determine whether we have missed the train. ^ref-51082

summarize:        •  Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the environment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.        •  Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.        •  Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function. ^ref-50417

---
— location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCCZJ4L&location=533)
In design, signifiers are more important than affordances, for they communicate how to use the design. ^ref-60110
