Good cycle timing — combined with an effective investment approach and the involvement of exceptional people — has accounted for the vast bulk of the success of my firm, Oaktree Capital Management. ^ref-53040

Some patterns and events recur regularly in our environment, influencing our behavior and our lives. ^ref-51946

---
— location: [66](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BH1R2T1&location=66)
humans use our ability to recognize and understand patterns to make our decisions easier, increase benefits and avoid pain. Importantly, we depend on our knowledge of recurring patterns so we won’t have to reconsider every decision from scratch. ^ref-5456

Economies, companies and markets also operate pursuant to patterns. ^ref-61075

---
— location: [71](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BH1R2T1&location=71)
these patterns are commonly called cycles. ^ref-17141

arise from naturally occurring phenomena but, importantly, also from the ups and downs of human psychology and from the resultant human behavior. ^ref-56993

these cycles aren’t as regular ^ref-60420

---
— location: [74](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BH1R2T1&location=74)
If we pay attention to cycles, we can come out ahead. If we study past cycles, understand their origins and import, and keep alert for the next one, we don’t have to reinvent the wheel in order to understand every investment environment anew. And we have less of a chance of being blindsided by events. We can master these recurring patterns for our betterment. ^ref-40852

In order to properly position a portfolio for what’s going on in the environment — and for what that implies regarding the future of the markets — the investor has to maintain a high level of attention. Events happen equally to everyone who is operating in a given environment. But not everyone listens to them equally in the sense of paying attention, being aware of them, and thus potentially figuring out their import. ^ref-29953

investors who disregard where they stand in cycles are bound to suffer serious consequences. ^ref-509

an investor has to learn to recognize cycles, assess them, look for the instructions they imply, and do what they tell him to do. ^ref-44567

In investing, there is nothing that always works, since the environment is always changing, and investors’ efforts to respond to the environment cause it to change further. ^ref-36858

I WHY STUDY CYCLES? ^ref-33827

— location: [150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BH1R2T1&location=150)
The odds change as our position in the cycles changes. If we don’t change our investment stance as these things change, we’re being passive regarding cycles; in other words, we’re ignoring the chance to tilt the odds in our favor. But if we apply some insight regarding cycles, we can increase our bets and place them on more aggressive investments when the odds are in our favor, and we can take money off the table and increase our defensiveness when the odds are against us. ^ref-50614

Investing is a matter of preparing for the financial future. It’s simple to define the task: we assemble portfolios today that we hope will benefit from the events that unfold in the years ahead. ^ref-1398

macro developments play a dominant role in determining the performance of markets these days, “macro investors” as a whole have shown rather unimpressive results. ^ref-39552

It’s not that the macro doesn’t matter, but rather that very few people can master it. For most, it’s just not knowable ^ref-61812

While there are lots of details and nuances, I think we can most gainfully spend our time in three general areas: ^ref-41264

trying to know more than others about what I call “the knowable”: the fundamentals of industries, companies and securities, ^ref-29486

judgments regarding what an asset can produce in the future — usually in terms of earnings or cash flow — and what those prospects make the asset worth today. ^ref-45195

— location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07BH1R2T1&location=180)
to do that successfully, they have to (a) quantify an asset’s intrinsic value and how it’s likely to change over time and (b) assess how the current market price compares with the asset’s intrinsic value, past prices for the asset, the prices of other assets, and “theoretically fair” prices for assets in general. ^ref-16173
